### Order of Steps: EDA, Checking Assumptions, and Data Transformation

The process of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **checking statistical assumptions**, and **transforming data** typically happens in a specific order. Here’s the general workflow:

---

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**EDA comes first** because it helps you understand the basic characteristics of the data, identify potential issues, and form hypotheses before building any models.

- **Objective**: Understand the structure, patterns, and quality of the data.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, standard deviation).
  - **Visualizations** (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, pair plots).
  - **Check for missing values**, outliers, and skewness.
  - **Correlation matrix** to understand relationships between variables.

**Key Outputs of EDA**:
- Insights into which variables are likely to be important.
- Identification of issues like outliers, skewness, and multicollinearity.
- Visualization of data distribution and relationships between variables.

### **2. Checking Statistical Assumptions (Pre-Modeling Step)**
After EDA, when you start thinking about building models (like regression), it’s important to check the **statistical assumptions** required for those models. This helps you ensure the data meets the requirements for reliable modeling.

- **Objective**: Ensure the data meets the assumptions required for regression models (or other statistical models).
- **Assumptions Checked**:
  - **Linearity** (scatter plots, residuals vs. fitted plot).
  - **Independence of errors** (Durbin-Watson test).
  - **Homoscedasticity** (Breusch-Pagan test, residuals vs. fitted plot).
  - **Normality of residuals** (Q-Q plot, Shapiro-Wilk test).
  - **Multicollinearity** (correlation matrix, Variance Inflation Factor).
  - **Outliers and leverage points** (Cook’s Distance, leverage statistics).

---

### **3. Data Transformation (If Necessary)**
If any statistical assumptions are violated during the assumption-checking process, you may need to **transform the data** to correct the issues. Data transformations are performed only if necessary, based on the results of the assumption checks.

- **When to Transform**:
  - **Skewed Data**: Apply transformations like log, square root, or Box-Cox to correct skewness.
  - **Non-Linearity**: Use transformations (e.g., polynomial, log) to linearize relationships.
  - **Heteroscedasticity**: Use transformations to stabilize variance (e.g., log transformation).
  - **Multicollinearity**: PCA, or drop or combine highly correlated variables, or apply regularization (Ridge/Lasso).
  - **Outliers**: Either remove extreme outliers or use robust techniques to minimize their impact.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Log Transformation**: Useful for positively skewed data (e.g., prices, income).
  - **Square Root Transformation**: Good for moderately skewed data.
  - **Box-Cox Transformation**: A flexible method for handling skewness and heteroscedasticity.
  - **Normalization/Standardization**: Used when variables are on different scales.

---

### **4. Re-Check Assumptions After Transformation**
Once transformations are applied, it’s important to re-check the assumptions to ensure the issues have been addressed. This step ensures the model will now perform properly.

- **Objective**: Confirm that the transformations have corrected issues like skewness, heteroscedasticity, or multicollinearity.

---

### **5. Model Building (Regression or Other Techniques)**
After checking assumptions and transforming data (if necessary), you can proceed to build and fit your model.

- **Objective**: Use the transformed data to build a reliable predictive or inferential model.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Multiple linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.

---

### **6. Post-Modeling Evaluation**
After fitting the model, you may evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like **R-squared**, **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**, or **p-values**. Additionally, you’ll recheck the model assumptions (e.g., normality of residuals) to ensure the model’s validity.

---

### **Summary of the Order**:

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - Understand data structure, patterns, and identify issues.
   - Visualize relationships between variables.
   
2. **Check Statistical Assumptions**:
   - Ensure the data meets the assumptions for modeling.
   - Check for linearity, multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, normality, etc.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - If assumptions are violated, apply necessary transformations (e.g., log, Box-Cox).
   
4. **Re-Check Assumptions**:
   - Ensure the transformations corrected any violations.
   
5. **Model Building**:
   - Fit the regression model (or other model) with the cleaned and transformed data.

6. **Post-Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance and recheck assumptions.
